# Language translations for the 2factor plugin

The folders in `languages/` contain the translated language strings used by this plugin.

## I want to add a new language, what do I do?

If your language is one of NodeBB's supported languages (check to see if [it is listed here](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/tree/master/public/language)).

If so, then great! Create a pull request containing a new folder with the same language code (e.g. "de" for German), containing the file `2factor.json`. It is easiest to just copy one of the existing files and translate it into your own language.

Submit the PR, and if all is well, I will accept and publish a new version with the langauge included. That's all :)

#2. Create and view new anonymous post

The user is able to create a new post as usual, but also has the option to make the post anonymous by checking the anonymous post option.

The post will display without a user icon and “Anonymous” as the post author.

The post can be edited and deleted like a normal post by the original post author. However, once a non-anonymous post is created, it cannot be changed to be an anonymous post, and vice-versa.
